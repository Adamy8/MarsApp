## 🚀 Project Description
- Fully responsive frontend built with Next.js + React.
- Backend API powered by Node.js.
- Deployed using Vercel (frontend) and Render (backend).
- RESTful API integration between frontend and backend.
- Stored applications in MongoDB.

## ✨ Current Features
- `Apply now`: Multi-stage form for application (able to go back-and-forth)
- `All Applications`(top right corner): fetch from MongoDB, display all applications
- `Delete`: Delete applications if not wanted
- `Show more`: show the full content of the application

## 🚧 Work in Progress
- 🥴 When right after finishing applying, clicking `All applications` will lead to a client side error.
  - ‼️ ***Need to refresh page.*** <br>
- 🧰 Deploy through AWS paid services. `Render free tier`(backend server provider) deactivates after 15min inactivity.
  - ❗️It **takes a few seconds** to spin up again each time. <br>
  - If you application didn't work/ Applications board shows nothing: `Please wait for a few seconds.`
- 🎏 Better UIUX for /board page, reveal all applications with better style.
- 📈 Current structure uses a seperate server. May combine them for easy deployment in the future.
- 🔑 Authentication for visiting the all applicaitons page.
- 📮 Integrate Email Notification API to send confirmation email to the user after applying.
